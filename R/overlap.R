#' Overlapping motif hit probabilities
#'
#' This function computes a set of self-overlapping probabilites for a
#' motif and background model.
#' 
#' The `gamma`s are determined based on two-dimensional score 
#' distributions (similar as described in Pape et al. 2008),
#' however, they are computed based on an order-d background model.
#' On the other hand, the `beta`s represent overlapping hit probabilities
#' that were corrected for intermediate hits.
#' 
#' @inheritParams numMotifHits
#' @return A list containing various overlapping hit probabilities.
#' The list contains the following entries
#'     \describe{
#'     \item{alpha}{False positive probability}
#'     \item{beta}{Vector of overlapping hit probability for hits
#'             occurring on the same strand. Each element corresponds to
#'             relative distance of the starts of the two hits.}
#'     \item{beta3p}{Vector of overlapping hit probability for a
#'             forward strand hit that is followed by a reverse strand
#'             hit. Each element corresponds to
#'             relative distance of the starts of the two hits.}
#'     \item{beta5p}{Vector of overlapping hit probability for a
#'             reverse strand hit that is followed by a forward strand
#'             hit. Each element corresponds to
#'             relative distance of the starts of the two hits.}
#'     \item{gamma}{Vector of overlapping hit probabilities across
#'             all configurations. In contrast to beta, beta3p and beta5p,
#'             gamma is not corrected for intermediate motif hit events.}
#'     \item{singlestranded}{singlestranded flag that is prescribed 
#'             as input argument.}
