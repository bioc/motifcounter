Description: 'motifcounter' provides functionality
    to compute statistics related with 
    motif matching and counting of motif matches in DNA 
    sequences for motifs that are given by position frequency matrices (PFMs)
    and under the assumption that the sequence drawn from 
    a higher-order background model.
    The package implements an efficient algorithm for computing
    the distribution of the scores under the above stated assumptions,
    which is used to
    determine the score threshold for a user-prescribed significance level.
    This allows to control the rate false positive predictions when searching
    for motif matches.
    Moreover, 'motifcounter' provides implementations for a compound
    Poisson approximation and a combinatorial model to efficiently approximate
    the distribution of the motif match counts, which for the basis for a
    motif hit enrichment test.
    These models take higher-order background models, the motif's
    self-similarity, as well as self-overlapping motif matches when
    both DNA strands are scanned into account. 
    The package is in particular useful for long motifs and/or relaxed
    choices of score thresholds, because the implemented algorithms bypass
    the need for enumerating a (potentially huge) set of DNA words 
    that can give rise to a motif match.
