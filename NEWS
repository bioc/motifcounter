CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.4
-------------------------
o Accept DNAString wherever DNAStringSet
  was accepted.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.3
-------------------------
o Fast motif matching
  Various improvements to improve
  motif matching speed were implemented.
  1. Precomputed position weights
  to avoid the invokation of the log function
  during scanning. 2. threshold argument
  added to avoid having to determine the score
  distribution for each sequence individually.
  3. Stop as soon as the motif score cannot
  or is certainly exceeding the threshold.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.2
-------------------------
o scoreSequence, 
  scoreHistogram, scoreProfile
  motifHits, motifHitProfile can
  be used with N-containing sequences.
  Positions at which the motif overlaps
  with N's will be NaN.
o Background can be computed from
  a DNAString in addition to a DNAStringSet
  object.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.1
-------------------------
o Background can be computed with
  sequences that contain N's.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2
-------------------------
o Changed contact information

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.9
-------------------------
o Removed compiler warnings
o Changes to the vignette

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.8
-------------------------
o Internal refactoring
o Changed citation information
